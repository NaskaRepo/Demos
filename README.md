Some python demos I tossed together.  They are only supported on widowns for the moment due to the use of 'msvcrt' and 'ctypes.dll'.

To exit any of the app press 'ESC'

For 'sand.py' the left and right arrow keys will move the spawner.  'Z' spawns dirt, 'X' spawns sand, 'C' spawns rock, and 'V' spawns water.
